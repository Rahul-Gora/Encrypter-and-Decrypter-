# Encrypter-and-Decrypter-
To encrypt and decrypt with Python, I have created a program in which it will first ask you if you want to encrypt a message or decrypt it.
Then the program should receive a message from the user.
If the user chooses to encrypt the message, the userâ€™s message must be transformed into a secret code. 
But if the user chooses to decrypt the message, your program should be able to convert a secret code into a meaningful text.
